COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT SPECIFICATION FOR REPLIT AI
================================================

PROJECT NAME: PromptCraft AI
OBJECTIVE: Build a complete, professional full-stack web application that helps users create, optimize, and manage AI prompts for different content types (images, videos, websites, code, text, audio, presentations).

========================================
CORE CONCEPT
========================================

Create an intelligent prompt engineering assistant that connects to multiple AI APIs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) and uses best practices from each platform to generate optimized, detailed prompts. The app should function as an expert prompt engineer - similar to how ChatGPT helps create prompts, but specialized and optimized for various platforms and content types.

- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui component library
- React Router for navigation
- Framer Motion for animations
- Lucide React for icons

Backend:
